# Data Analyst Portfolio
My data portfolio to showcase my projects relating to anything and everything data.

## Introduction
Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Bernard Kofi Essiamah and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data gathering with APIs, data wrangling, data visualization and presentation skills. Most of my projects are built using Microsoft Excel, PostgreSQL, Tableau, Python and Power BI.

In the following sections of this README, I will summarize my data journey and briefly describe the projects in each folder. Let's get started!

## About Me & My Data Journey
I am currently working under contract as an HR Data Analyst at Gundersen Health Systems, Wisconsin, USA where my primary job is to collaborate with stakeholders and create visualizations and reports in Microsoft Power BI per their requirements, assist the Data Engineering team in optimizing ETL processes, etc. I had the opportunity to practice and learn some data engineering techniques and skills in my current role, which I am still improving upon.

My data journey began right after I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana. I took up a business intelligence bootcamp after which I had the chance to intern at Integral Ad Science, a media advertising company in the USA. During this role, after teaming up with the Data Team on several occasions for tasks and reports, it opened up my interest in the data exploration field. I then continued with the Google Data Analytics Professional certification and still learning more here.

## Projects
### Project1_1 - Healthcare Patient Experience
The primary objective of this notebook is to identify the factors affecting patients' healthcare experience in hospitals across the United States.
This analysis will focus on identifying the main elements influencing the Net Promoter Score (NPS) for patient satisfaction in various healthcare facilities. I will accomplish this by utilizing data visualisation processes and completing statistical tests to validate hypotheses based on data.

A full documentation of this entire project can be read on **[Medium](https://medium.com/@beko50/patient-experience-analyzing-net-promoter-score-nps-trends-in-healthcare-facilities-in-the-u-s-72ef8eeb613a)**

### Project_1 - FIFA World Cup Insights
This is my very first project in my Data Analysis journey and being a huge football fan, I decided to start with the simplest datasets I found on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/fifa-football-world-cup-dataset)** website, which contains all previous editions from 1930 to 2022. I went ahead with analyzing football in the 21st Century (2002-2022) because the game has vastly changed and these were the ones I experienced mostly. The FIFA World Cup tournament takes place every 4 years with 32 qualified countries worldwide partaking in it. I also added a new column 'Win Rate' to analyze the performance of these countries in a selected period. I started working with the datasets in Microsoft Excel before importing them into PostgreSQL and making visualizations with Tableau. 

### Project_2 - Biking Accessories Analysis
For this project, I chose to analyze data within the e-commerce sector, focusing specifically on biking accessories and products. I focused on key performance indicators (KPIs) and trending metrics for the biking accessories market in North America, Europe, and the Pacific, including analyzing sales, returns, monthly and yearly targets, and profits. Following the March 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people worldwide looked for alternate methods to move around and stay active when gyms shut down and public transportation became unsafe. In the U.S., consumer spending on bicycles and accessories peaked in 2021, according to adjusted figures from the *U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis*.  Datasets were obtained from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/algorismus/adventure-works-in-excel-tables/data)**

The skills I've focused on in this project are data cleaning and data exploration(analysis and exploration) with Power BI. Additionally, there are questions I have asked and answered after building the dashboards.

### Project_3 - HR Analytics: Employee Attrition
In this HR analytics project using Python, the focus was on understanding employee attrition within any organization. I analyzed employee data to identify patterns and trends in employee performance and overall satisfaction. Using Exploratory Data Analysis, I will answer questions that these organizations are interested in. Datasets are fictional and created by IBM data scientists from **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset/data)**

The skills I've focused on in this project are data exploration and statistics with Python.
